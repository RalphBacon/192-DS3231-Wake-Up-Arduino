DS3231 Wiring details:

VCC - +5v on Arduino
GND - GND on Arduino

SDA - A4 or pin marked SDA (Serial I2C Data)
SCL - A5 or pin marked SCL (Serial I2C Clock)

SQW - 'Square Wave' but we're using this to trigger the Arduino
when the alarm time is reached. The pin  goes LOW at alarm time.
Connect to the interrupt pin D3 (You can also use D2 to 
wake up the Arduino but we're using that to flash an LED).

Connect an LED with a 150 ohm resistor in series from pin 2 to GND.

The Arduino chip in my video is just an ATMega328P wired as follows:

VCC - +5v
GND - GND
0.1μA capacitor between VCC and GND
0.1μA capacitor between AVCC and GND

NOTE: it has been flashed to run from the INTERNAL 8MHz oscillator.

If you have a standard Arduino board you can still try all this out
but your Arduino will consume too much current when sleeping. But OK
for a demo!
